# 🐍 Python Mini Projects

A collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python projects created for learning, experimentation, and portfolio building.  
Each project focuses on core programming concepts — from file handling to GUI development — and is documented for easy reference.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This repository contains several small Python applications I built while studying Computer Science and self-learning practical programming.  
Each project started as a learning exercise, then grew into something functional and shareable.

I’m keeping this repo public as a **portfolio of my coding journey** — showing progress from console apps to GUI-based tools.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

Through these projects, I’m practicing:
- Writing clean, reusable Python code  
- Managing files, user input, and data storage  
- Creating graphical user interfaces (GUI)  
- Using external libraries (Tkinter, CustomTkinter, Pygame, OpenCV)  
- Version control and project documentation with GitHub

## ⚙️ How to Use

Each folder contains:
- A **Python script (`.py`)**
- A **README.md** explaining features, dependencies, and run instructions

To run any project:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/python-mini-projects.git
   ```
2. Open the terminal and navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd mood_tracker
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python mood_tracker.py
   ```

## 🧩 Repository Structure
```yaml
python-mini-projects/
├── mood_tracker/
├── music_player/
├── modern_music_player/
├── screen_recorder/
└── digital_clock/
```

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Build GUI version of Mood Tracker
- Add visualizations (Matplotlib)
- Create a web-based Flask version
- Expand documentation and testing coverage
- Possibly turn selected projects into mini open-source apps
