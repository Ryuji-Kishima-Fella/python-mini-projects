# 🐍 Python Mini Projects

A collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python projects created for learning, experimentation, and portfolio building.  
Each project focuses on core programming concepts — from file handling to GUI development — and is documented for easy reference.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This repository contains several small Python applications I built while studying Computer Science and self-learning practical programming.  
Each project started as a learning exercise, then grew into something functional and shareable.

I’m keeping this repo public as a **portfolio of my coding journey** — showing progress from console apps to GUI-based tools.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

Through these projects, I’m practicing:
- Writing clean, reusable Python code  
- Managing files, user input, and data storage  
- Creating graphical user interfaces (GUI)  
- Using external libraries (Tkinter, CustomTkinter, Pygame, OpenCV)  
- Version control and project documentation with GitHub
